# Jellycraft Juggernauts - Status Effects

## Overview
This document defines the various **Status Effects** in *Jellycraft Juggernauts*, providing structured mechanics for each effect, its duration, triggers, and resolution method. These effects play a crucial role in battles by modifying Juggernaut behaviors, actions, and vulnerabilities.

## Status Effects Schema
Each status effect is defined with the following attributes:

- **`name`**: The effectâ€™s name.
- **`effect`**: A brief description of how the effect modifies the target's abilities.
- **`X-value`**: A numerical value associated with the effect (if applicable).
- **`X-value-type`**: Defines what the X-value represents (e.g., damage, turns, armor, etc.).
- **`duration-type`**: Specifies how long the effect lasts (`turns`, `rounds`, `trigger`, or `permanent`).
- **`duration-value`**: Specifies the numeric duration of the effect if applicable.
- **`duration-trigger-type`**: Defines a condition under which the effect's duration is modified.
- **`duration-trigger-target`**: Specifies the entity that triggers the duration change.
- **`effect-trigger-type`**: The event that activates the effect.
- **`effect-trigger-target`**: The entity that is affected by the effect-trigger.
- **`conflict-type`**: The resolution method for contested effects (e.g., `Rock-Paper-Scissors`, `Coin Flip`, `None`).
