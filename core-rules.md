# **Jellycraft Juggernauts - Core Rules**
Feb 27, 2025

## **1. Game Objective**
The goal of *Jellycraft Juggernauts* is to reduce your opponent's Juggernauts to zero by depleting their **Jelly** (health). Players strategically **Jellycraft** their Juggernauts by attaching **Jelly Parts** and allocating **Jelly Jems**, enabling powerful **Jelly Arts** to outmaneuver their opponent.

---

## **2. Game Setup**
- Each player begins with a **deck of 40-50 cards**, consisting of:
  - **Jelly Parts** (for modifying Juggernauts)
  - **Jelly Jems** (for powering Jelly Parts)
  - **Trainer Commands** (for strategic interventions)
- Each deck must contain **no more than 1/3rd Jelly Jems** to maintain resource tension.
- Each player starts with **one Juggernaut** (a blank slate) and draws **five cards**.
- Players determine the first turn by flipping a coin.

---

## **3. Turn Structure**
Each turn follows a structured sequence:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Draw OR Issue Trainer Command**
- Players choose to either **draw a card** or **play a Trainer Command**.
- **Reaction Trainer Commands** must be played onto the battlefield during this phase. They may be placed **face down** to hide their ability until activated during a later **Reaction phase**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Action Phase (Choose One)**
Players may take one of the following actions:
- **Jellycraft:** Attach **Jelly Jems** to your Juggernaut and manage Jem allocation.
- **Morph:** Attach and/or activate **Jelly Parts**, modifying your Juggernaut's capabilities.
- **Jelly Art:** Use a **Jelly Art** from an active **Jelly Part**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Reaction Phase**
- The **Defender** may declare one **Reaction** per round, using a **Reaction**-specific **Jelly Art** or **Trainer Command**.
- **Status effects** resolve before damage (e.g., **Burn(1)** applies before the attack lands).
- If a **status effect** like **Stun** or **Confuse** interrupts the attack, it does not proceed.

---

## **4. Jellycrafting & Resource Management**
- **Jelly Parts** require **Jelly Jems** to be attached.
- Once a **Jelly Jem is allocated** to a Jelly Part, the Juggernaut can use its **Jelly Arts**.
- Players must carefully manage their Jelly Jem capacity to maximize their efficiency and safeguard them from disruption.

---

## **5. Jelly Arts & Combat**
- Each **Jelly Part** grants access to specific **Jelly Arts**. Once a **Jelly Part** is active, 
- Jelly Arts may have **Ranged**, **Touch**, **Ambient**, or **Self** targeting.
- Jelly Arts may apply **status effects**, such as **Burn**, **Stun**, **Restrain**, etc.
- Some Jelly Arts may allow **Jellymancy** - upgrading certain **Jelly Arts**, and potentially unlocking more powerful **Jelly Parts**.

---

## **6. Status Effects**
Status effects modify a Juggernaut‚Äôs performance. Some are resolved via **coin flips**, while others use **Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)**. Here's a few examples:

| **Status Effect** | **Effect** |
|--------------|--------|
| **Burn (X)** | Increases damage taken by X. |
| **Poison (X)** | Deals X damage at the end of each turn. |
| **Gooify (X)** | Deals X damage whenever an Action is performed. |
| **Restrain** | *(RPS)* Blocks Actions this turn. |
| **Lockdown** | Disables a specific Jelly Art. |
| **Confuse** | *(Coin Flip)* If tails, ability targets self. |
| **Mark (X)** | Permanently increases damage taken by X from a specific opponent. |

---

## **7. The Scrap Jar (Discard Pile)**
- **Destroyed or Discarded Jelly Parts & Jelly Jems** go to the **Scrap Jar**.
- **Trainer Commands** are automatically discarded to the **Scrap Jar** after use.
- Some **Jelly Arts** and **Trainer Commands** allow players to manipulate the **Scrap Jar**, such as retrieving, reshuffling, or exiling cards.

---

## **8. Winning the Game**
- A player wins when their opponent **has no active Juggernauts remaining**.
- A Juggernaut is removed when its **Jelly (health) reaches zero**.
- Play continues as long as there are two or more opposing Juggernauts on the battlefield.
